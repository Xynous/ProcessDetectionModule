This class has been developed towards game developers who would like to lower the rate of cheaters in their game, but this can be used for anything else you wish to use it for.

# How to use:
To use this function for your project, you will need to implement depending on what sort of project you doing. The methods to implement this is;

1. Implement the class it self into your project and make a call to the class using a object. Which is the recommended option

2. Implement the code into your own class and call the method (This depends on how you developed your project).

3. Or run it as an executable application, but this means this application will be running as a seperate application / Binary.
